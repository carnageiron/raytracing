# Ray Tracing

![Ray Tracing Demo](test.jpg)

This repository contains a simple ray tracing implementation in C++. Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to simulate the way light interacts with objects in a scene, producing realistic images.

## Features

- Basic ray tracing algorithm
- Sphere rendering with shading
- Parallel rendering using multiple threads

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler like "GCC" or "CLANG" etc
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carnageiron/raytracing.git
   cd raytracing
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   clang main.cc
   ```

3. Run the ray tracer:

   ```bash
   (For Linux Users only): chmod +x  a.out
   ./a.out
   ```

4. Enjoy the rendered image (`output.png`)!

## Configuration

You can adjust various settings in the `main.cc` file, such as image dimensions, camera properties, and scene setup.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the ray tracing implementation, feel free to submit a pull request.
